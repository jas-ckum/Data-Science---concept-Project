# Data-Science (Basic concept with real time problem)


## While learning the concept of "__DATA SCIENCE__" I prepered few sheets, covering the basic concept of few topic which requires to built a good model  and also started a real  time project . 
please go through the document in the following sequence .

1. Concept
2. Data

4. Programming language
5. Algorithm
6. SKlearn

  a. logistic_regression , b. Decision_Tree_Classification , c. KNN , d . Random_Forest_Classification
  
7. Home-Loan

As I was primerally given focus on the basic concept , and writing codes in python , so their is a possiblity of mistakes in English grammer & spellings , so please excuse me for that .

All the code that I have written in python can be easily write in SAS also .
